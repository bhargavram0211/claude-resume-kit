## QUICK BUDGET CARD (read this FIRST)

```
RESUME (1-page, resume.cls):  ~8-10 variable bullets | 2-3 projects | Skills 11 lines (4-3-2-2) | optional awards

Resume bullet: max 2 rendered lines | 1L: 105-111 chars | 2L: 189-205 chars (target ~200)
Project bullet: max 2 rendered lines | 1L/2L same as resume bullets

Cover letter: Resume = 1 page (250-300 words)
Full package: Resume + CL = 2 pages
```

**If your bullet count doesn't match the budget above, STOP and fix before generating.**

## Section-by-Section Specs

### Resume (resume.cls, 1-page)

1. **Summary** (bundle Section 2): 3-4 sentences, 3-4 body lines. 400-500 rendered chars (HARD MAX 500). Orphan: last line >= 60 chars.
   - **Headline Tagline:** 60-80 rendered chars, exactly 1 line (role + primary skill/domain + impact).
2. **Technical Skills** (bundle Section 4 + skills_guide.md): Format C — 4 groups, default 4-3-2-2 (11 lines). Each dash = exactly 1 rendered line. Bold penalty: 119 - (0.5 x bold_chars).
3. **Experience** (experience files for detected persona): Write bullets FRESH per Experience Bullet Writing Protocol (below). Max 2 rendered lines per bullet. Run char_count.py after each position.
   - resume.cls: Args 3+4 on SAME italic line
   - Budget: ~8-10 total bullets across all experience positions
   - **After all positions: verify total experience bullet count matches budget**
4. **Projects** (resume_builder/projects/ pool, scored by JD keywords): Select 2-3 projects per JD. Each project: header (name + stack) + 1-2 bullets. Run char_count.py after all projects.
   - Use persona-matching bullet variant (DevOps frame or SWE frame)
5. **Education**: FIXED — copy from template
6. **Honors & Awards**: FIXED — items from template (optional)
7. **Immigration notice**: FIXED for USA JDs. Delete for non-USA JDs.

## Character Limits (HARD STOPS — ZERO TOLERANCE)

**MANDATORY: Count rendered characters for EVERY bullet BEFORE writing it.** Do not write a bullet and check afterward — pre-calculate the count. If a bullet exceeds the limit, rewrite it BEFORE moving to the next bullet. This is not a post-generation check; it is a per-bullet gate.

**How to count rendered characters:**
Strip all LaTeX markup before counting: `\textbf{X}` -> X, `\textit{X}` -> X, `\ce{X}` -> X, `$\beta$` -> 1 char, `\sim` -> 1 char, `$<$` -> 1 char, `$^\dagger$` -> 1 char, `--` -> 1 char (en-dash), `\underline{X}` -> X, `\href{url}{text}` -> text only.
Count: all remaining characters including spaces.

**Resume (10pt, textwidth=7.5in):**

| Target Lines | Rendered Char Range | HARD MAX | Orphan Threshold |
|-------|---------------|---------|------------------|
| 1 line | 105-111 chars | 117 | -- |
| 2 lines | 189-205 chars | 218 | Last line >= 78 chars |

> **WARNING: AIM FOR THE MIDDLE OF THE TARGET RANGE — NOT THE HARD MAX.**
> A Resume-2L bullet should target ~200 chars, not 218. A CV-2L should target ~175, not 190.
> The hard max exists as a safety valve, not a target. Proportional fonts have variable char widths —
> a bullet at the hard max WILL overflow if it contains wide characters (m, w, W, capitals, em-dashes).
> Em-dash (---) counts as 1 char but renders ~2x wide. Budget 2 extra chars per em-dash in the bullet.

### Variant Naming

| Variant | Document | Lines | Target Range | HARD MAX | Orphan | Word Target |
|---------|----------|-------|-------------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Resume-1L | 1/2-page resume | 1 | 105-111 | 117 | -- | ~13 words |
| Resume-2L | 2-page resume | 2 | 189-205 | 218 | >= 78 | ~23-25 words |
| CV-2L | 5-page CV | 2 | 168-182 | 190 | >= 65 | ~21-22 words |
| CV-3L | 5-page CV | 3 | 250-268 | 280 | >= 65 | ~31-32 words |

> **Word targets** are approximate first-draft heuristics for prose bullets (~7.9 chars/word). After drafting, always verify with precise char count. Skills dashes: NO word proxy -- use iterative char count only (technical tool lists average ~11 chars/word).

### Bold Width Penalty (COMPILE-VERIFIED)

Bold characters render wider than normal text. Adjust effective char limits accordingly.

**Resume (10pt):** Effective limit = 119 - (0.5 x bold_char_count)
- 0 bold: safe up to 119 chars/line
- 2-4 bold tools (~10-25 bold chars): 107-112 effective --> use 105-111 as default
- 5+ bold tools (~28+ bold chars): ~105 effective --> tighten to 99-105

Practical rule: count bold characters, subtract half from base limit.

**Per-bullet enforcement protocol:**
1. Write the bullet text (LaTeX source)
2. Strip all markup mentally → count rendered chars
3. If count > HARD MAX → rewrite immediately (do NOT proceed)
4. If multi-line and last line < orphan threshold → rewrite to fill or shorten
5. **Aim for the middle of the range**, not the max. A bullet at 220 rendered chars (resume 2L) is risky — target ~200.

**Orphan rule:** For any multi-line bullet, the last rendered line must fill at least 70% of the line width. If it doesn't, rewrite to either fill the line or shorten to one fewer line.

### Char Verification Protocol (EVERY written element)

For each element you write from scratch or modify (summary, skills dash, tagline, any edited bullet):

1. **DRAFT** -- Use word-count target as initial guess (prose only, NOT skills dashes)
2. **STRIP** -- Remove LaTeX markup (\textbf{}, \ce{}, $..$) to get rendered text
3. **COUNT** -- Count rendered characters precisely. In Claude Code, use the helper: `python3 resume_builder/helpers/char_count.py "bullet text"` or verify a full .tex file: `python3 resume_builder/helpers/char_count.py -f [resume|cv] output/file.tex`
4. **CHECK** -- Compare against target range (use tighter targets from Variant Naming table, not HARD MAX)
5. **FIX** -- If OVER and attempts < 3: rewrite/trim, go to step 2
6. **FLAG** -- If OVER after 3 attempts: add `% OVER LIMIT: [N] chars, target [M]` LaTeX comment, move on
7. **PASS** -- If within range: move to next element

**RULE: Never move to the next section with a violation in the current one. Fix first, then proceed.**

## Page Fill Budgets

**1-Page Resume (resume.cls, 10pt):**

Technical Skills uses Format C (categorized dash sub-items, 4 groups).

**Variable Bullet Budget:**

The exact variable bullet count depends on your skills configuration and whether a USA immigration line is present. Typical range: **8-10 variable experience bullets + 2-6 project bullets** on 1-page resume. Budget allocation:

| Element | Lines | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Header + Summary | 4-5 | Fixed |
| Technical Skills (4-3-2-2) | 11 | Fixed |
| Experience (2-3 positions) | 6-8 | Variable (2-3 bullets per position) |
| Projects (2-3 items) | 4-6 | Variable (1-2 bullets per project) |
| Education | 2 | Fixed |
| Awards (optional) | 1-2 | Fixed/Optional |
| Total rendered lines | ~32-35 | Fits 1 page comfortably |

**Adjustments:**
- Add more projects → reduce experience bullets (vice versa)
- Remove awards section → +1 space for experience or projects
- Remove immigration line → +0.5 lines available

**Position header rule:** The position title + date must fit on ONE line. If the title is too long, shorten the title so the date doesn't wrap to a second line. Wrapped dates waste a full vertical line and break visual alignment. Test by compiling — if the date wraps, trim the title.

**Budget workflow:** Plan bullet allocation per position BEFORE generating. After generation, verify that total rendered lines stay under 38 (leaving ~1 inch margins). Use `python3 resume_builder/helpers/char_count.py -f resume output/resume.tex` to verify.

---

## Experience Bullet Writing Protocol (Experience-File-First)

**DO NOT use pre-written bullets.** Write every bullet FRESH from experience files, reframed for the target JD.

**Required files:** Experience files (detected persona variant) + bundle Section 3 (Reframing Map)

**Protocol:**
1. Determine document format → look up bullet variant (Resume-2L) and 1-page budget (8-10 experience bullets)
2. Allocate bullet count per position by JD relevance
3. For each position, consult bundle's **Reframing Map** (Section 3) to identify target vocabulary and framing angle
4. Write the bullet FRESH using target-domain vocabulary from the Reframing Map
5. Verify char count per-bullet BEFORE moving to the next bullet
6. After all bullets written: tally total bullet count — must equal or fall within 8-10 range

**Reframing during writing (NOT after):** Every bullet should use target-domain vocabulary from the start. Do not write in generic language and then "translate" — write in target language directly using the Reframing Map. This is the single highest-ROI step: reframing alone moves scores from ~60 to ~85.

**Persona consistency:** For a DevOps/SRE JD, use `experience_company_devops.md` bullets throughout. For a FullStack/SWE JD, use `experience_company_swe.md` bullets. Never mix personas in a single resume.

---

## Position Title Format

**Resume -- FLIPPED format (JD theme as bold title, role as subtitle):**
Bold line = JD-customized domain theme (the single most powerful JD customization lever).
Italic subtitle = formal role + institution.

| Position | Bold Line (JD-customizable) | Subtitle |
|----------|-----------------------------|----------|
| Position 1 | [Theme, e.g., "First-Principles Discovery & ML-Accelerated Simulation"] | [Your Role], [Institution] |
| Position 2 | [Theme] ([Notable Award if applicable]) | [Your Role], [Institution] |
| Position 3 | [Theme] ([Fellowship if applicable]) | [Your Role], [Institution 1] & [Institution 2] |
| Internship | [Theme — FIXED] | [Your Role], [Company] | FLIPPED but FIXED |

**CV -- CONVENTIONAL format:**
Bold line = formal role title. Mentors on separate line. Sub-headers = story threads (underlined).

## Immutable Elements — NEVER Modify

The following elements are set in the `.cls` files and templates. **NEVER change them in generated output:**

- **`\vspace` values** between sections — these are calibrated. Do not add, remove, or adjust.
- **`\geometry` settings** (margins, textwidth, textheight) — locked per template.
- **FIXED section content** (Education, Fellowships, Publications, Presentations, Mentorship, Collaborations, Computing, Internship) — copy verbatim from template. Never rewrite, trim, or reorder.
- **`.cls` formatting** (font sizes, section rules, item separators, skill group spacing) — never override with inline LaTeX.
- **Header layout** (name, email, location, icons) — structure is template-locked. Only the email address and link URLs are configurable.

**If content spills to an extra page (orphan lines):** Fix by shortening VARIABLE content only (summary, skills dashes, experience bullets). Count rendered characters to ensure bullets actually fit their target line count (2L or 3L). A bullet that is "2L" in the budget but renders as 3L due to character overflow is the most common cause of page spill. Before declaring any output done, compile with pdflatex and verify page count matches target (resume=2, CV=5).

**When updating an existing .tex output (not generating from scratch):** Only modify VARIABLE content — summary text, skills group names/dashes, experience bullet text, sub-theme names. Never touch FIXED sections, vspaces, geometry, or cls overrides, even if a critique flags them as improvable. If a critique targets a FIXED section, note it for the next full regeneration instead.

---

## Post-Generation Verification

Run this checklist after compile gate passes, before critique. Also used as Part 7 of critique_framework.md.

Before presenting final output, verify:

- [ ] All mechanical checks pass (chars, orphans, page fill, no submitted, sequences, variants)
- [ ] Em-dash count: max 2 per document (resume or CL). Fellowships items use `. ` not `---`.
- [ ] No -ing analysis endings on bullets ("...advancing the field", "...contributing to Y"). Restructure to end with a concrete result or metric.
- [ ] All content checks pass (ATS, terms, inflation, provenance, pubs, cover letter)
- [ ] All narrative checks pass (scan test, per-position flow, cross-position arc, CV sub-headers)
- [ ] Company/institution name spelled correctly throughout
- [ ] .tex file has complete preamble (will compile standalone)
- [ ] Date format consistent (Mon YYYY -- Mon YYYY)

## Role-Type Decision Tree

| If JD mentions... | Primary profile | Secondary (hybrid) |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| _[your domain keywords]_ | _[your role type]_ | _[secondary or --]_ |
| _Example: national lab, DOE, postdoc_ | _National Lab_ | _--_ |
| _Example: machine learning, neural networks_ | _ML/AI_ | _National Lab_ |
| _Example: protein modeling, structural biology_ | _Computational Biology_ | _--_ |

**Hybrid resumes:** When a JD spans two role types, merge the two profiles. Primary sets priority matrix; secondary contributes supplementary bullets and keywords.

Customize the decision tree above with your own role types, tools, and domains in `CLAUDE.md`.

---

## Gap Assessment & Bridge Mappings

For each identified gap, assess:
- **Gap description:** What the JD asks for
- **Bridge framing (if available):** Use "methodology transferable to X" or "equivalent experience with Y" -- NEVER "experienced with X" unless directly demonstrated
- **Bridge confidence:** HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
- **User decision:** Omit or bridge? (User decides per gap)

**Example bridge mappings** (customize for your own tools/methods):
- Tool A → "Custom solvers (Tool B/Tool C; computational methodology transferable to Tool A)" [HIGH]
- Framework A → "Deep learning framework expertise (Framework B; directly transferable to Framework A)" [HIGH]
- Simulation Package A → "Molecular dynamics expertise (Package B; transferable to Package A)" [HIGH]
- Language A → "Scientific computing (Language B, Language C; transferable to Language A)" [MEDIUM]

## Content Density Rules

| Format | Bullets | Publications | Awards | Presentations |
|--------|---------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| 1-page resume | ~6 | 3-5 | 2 | Omit |
| 2-page resume | ~12+ | 5-8 | 2-3 | May omit |
| 5-page CV | Comprehensive | All published + under review | All | All |
| Full CV | Everything | All published + under review | All | All |
